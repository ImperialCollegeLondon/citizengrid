CitizenGrid
===========
CitizenGrid platform allows Scientists to deploy their applications’ server virtual machine images on 
different cloud platforms and also register their application’s client virtual machine images with CitizenGrid. 
For Citizen Science Volunteer participants, CitizenGrid serves as an application portal where they can discover 
and participate in the applications by launching application clients on their local machine, or where applicable, 
on a remote cloud platform. Currently under development in pre-alpha phase.
